VQCDThermo
==========

A Mathematica package for computing thermodynamics (and more) in holographic Veneziano QCD. See [arxiv:1112.1261](http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.1261), [arxiv 1210.4516](http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.4516) and especially [To be published] for background on VQCD and the type of computations this package does.

This README is preliminary, and will be updated once the code itself has been uploaded.

What this code does
-------------------

This code takes care of much of the boilerplate in doing numerical computations in the VQCD model at finite temperature and finite chemical potential. The lowest level work, that is, setting up the boundary conditions, solving the differential equations, fixing the various scales and so on, is contained in a fully automated form. The computation of the thermodynamic parameter scans is present in an incomplete form, and the thermodynamic analysis is currently not contained here. The intent is, however, to publish these in the near future, once the code used in [to be published] has been brought to a form suitable for release.
